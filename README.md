# JSec

JSec is a simple security library which provides industry-standard encryption and hashing functions for Java applications. The library allows hashing using multiple algorithms and symmetric or asymmetric encryption. It is designed to be easy to use, speed up development time and allow developers to focus on other aspects of development rather than creating their own security packages.

<b>The package requires Java 8+</b>
